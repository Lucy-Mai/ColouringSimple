Simple colouring website to practice using the Canvas element and JavaScript in a website to make it more interactive.

Features: 
1. Tool selector including pen, pencil and eraser using buttons
2. Pen size slider with display for size input using input type="range"
3. Pen colour selector using input type ="color"

I plan to make a future, more advanced website with features inlcuding:
1. Multiple pages for choosing templates and backgrounds like lined or for handwriting practice
2. Ensure the mouse and 'drawing' are more calibrated
3. Add a way to store some colours, perhaps styling it like an artist's paint pallet
4. Have buttons stay in their selected, 'focus' mode until another is selected but still whilst painting
5. Have drawing appear more natural as opposed to adding lots of small circles. More like a line is drawn
6. Add ore tools, including a watercolour paintbrush
